# Total-Survived-Dead-in-Titanic
Count total Survived/Dead Based on Gender in Tragedy of RMS Titanic using Python.

Hello, guys! This is my first code using github. I will write continuously in this platform on my progress using Python, R, SQL.
I hope you guys enjoy it, and let me know if there are any corrections. Thank You, and Let's Start!

In this article, i want to know the total number of survived/dead passengers based on gender in the tragedy of RMS Titanic.
It is just a simple code and analysis as i try to learn python.
Here are the steps to do that.

   The first step is to download the data. I obtained the data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data named 'train.csv'. The data itself contains a table of    passengers that went on Titanic, and also the binary indicator whether they survived or not, with 1 means that they survived and 0 means that they died.
   Here is what the data looks like:
